# Safi Beats

Safi Beats is an "automatic" AI Lofi [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Safi_beats).

It worked by using an [unofficial suno-api](https://github.com/gcui-art/suno-api) to genertae music. Stability Diffusion 3 to generate images and then automatically uploaded them to YouTube.


This was one the least fun project I've made. But I learned a valuable lesson:
> *Don't try to build something, when someone is trying to break it*

I had issues with both Suno and YouTube.
Suno kept shadowbanning my accounts so they couldn't generate music.
But worst of all, YouTube kept invalidating my API key, so I had to manually get a new one every few days (instead of every month). Maybe the solution would be using unoffical YT API (or making one myself).

But atleast YouTube recommended my videos to many people, eventho nobody liked watching them.
