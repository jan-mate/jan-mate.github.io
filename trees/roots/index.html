They also have a specialized non-lignified tissue (the phloem ) to conduct products of photosynthesis. The group includes most land plants ( c. 300,000 accepted known species) other than mosses.","The Zingiberales are flowering plants forming one of four orders in the commelinids clade of monocots, together with its sister order, Commelinales. The order includes 68 genera and 2,600 species. Zingiberales are a unique though morphologically diverse order that has been widely recognised as such over a long period of time. They are usually large herbaceous plants with rhizomatous root systems and lacking an aerial stem except when flowering. Flowers are usually large and showy, and the stamens are often modified ( staminodes ) to also form colourful petal-like structures that attract pollinators.","Zingiberaceae ( / \u02cc z \u026a n d\u0292 \u026a b \u026a \u02c8 r e\u026a s i. i\u02d0 / ) or the ginger family is a family of flowering plants made up of about 50 genera with a total of about 1600 known species of aromatic perennial herbs with creeping horizontal or tuberous rhizomes distributed throughout tropical Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Many of the family's species are important ornamental, spice, or medicinal plants. Ornamental genera include the shell gingers ( Alpinia ), Siam or summer tulip ( Curcuma alismatifolia ), Globba, ginger lily ( Hedychium ), Kaempferia, torch-ginger Etlingera elatior, Renealmia, and ginger ( Zingiber ).

Its best known member is horseradish, Armoracia rusticana, which is the type species.","Asterales ( / \u02cc \u00e6 s t \u0259 \u02c8 r e\u026a l i\u02d0 z / ASS -t\u0259r- RAY -leez ) is an order of dicotyledonous flowering plants that includes the large family Asteraceae (or Compositae) known for composite flowers made of florets, and ten families related to the Asteraceae. While asterids in general are characterized by fused petals, composite flowers consisting of many florets create the false appearance of separate petals (as found in the rosids ).","Asteraceae ( / \u02cc \u00e6 s t \u0259 \u02c8 r e\u026a s i. i\u02d0, - \u02cc a\u026a / ) is a large family of flowering plants that consists of over 32,000 known species in over 1,900 genera within the order Asterales. The number of species in Asteraceae is rivaled only by the Orchidaceae, and which is the larger family is unclear as the quantity of extant species in each family is unknown. The Asteraceae were first described in the year 1740 and given the original name Compositae. The family is commonly known as the aster, daisy, composite, or sunflower family.","Tragopogon, also known as goatsbeard or salsify, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It includes the vegetable known as salsify, as well as a number of common wild flowers.","Taraxacum ( / t \u0259 \u02c8 r \u00e6 k s \u0259 k \u0259 m / ) is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae, which consists of species commonly known as dandelions. The scientific and hobby study of the genus is known as taraxacology. The genus is native to Eurasia but the two most commonplace species worldwide, T.\u00a0officinale (the common dandelion) and T.\u00a0erythrospermum (the red-seeded dandelion), were introduced from Europe into North America, where they are an invasive species. Dandelions thrive in temperate regions and can be found in yards, gardens, sides of roads, among crops, and in many other habitats. Both species are edible in their entirety and have a long history of consumption. The common name dandelion ( / \u02c8 d \u00e6 n d \u0259 l a\u026a. \u0259n / DAN -d\u0259-ly-\u0259n; from French dent-de-lion 'lion's tooth', referring to the jagged leaves) is also given to specific members of the genus.","Smallanthus is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Millerieae within the family Asteraceae.","Scorzonera is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Cichorieae within the family Asteraceae.","Microseris is a genus of plants in the tribe Cichorieae within the family Asteraceae, plants that often called composites.

Except for three South American species, the species of Helianthus are native to North America and Central America. The best-known species is the common sunflower ( Helianthus annuus ). This and other species, notably Jerusalem artichoke ( H. tuberosus ), are cultivated in temperate regions and some tropical regions, as food crops for humans, cattle, and poultry, and as ornamental plants. The species H. annuus typically grows during the summer and into early fall, with the peak growth season being mid-summer.","Arctium is a genus of biennial plants commonly known as burdock, family Asteraceae. Native to Europe and Asia, several species have been widely introduced worldwide. Burdock's clinging properties, in addition to providing an excellent mechanism for seed dispersal, led to the invention of the hook and loop fastener.","The Apiales are an order of flowering plants, included in the asterid group of dicotyledons. Well-known members of Apiales include carrots, celery, coriander, parsley, parsnips, poison hemlock, ginseng, ivies, and pittosporums.","The Araliaceae are a family of flowering plants composed of about 43 genera and around 1500 species consisting of primarily woody plants and some herbaceous plants commonly called the ginseng family. The morphology of Araliaceae varies widely, but it is predominantly distinguishable based on its woody habit, tropical distribution, and the presence of simple umbels.","The Panax ( ginseng ) genus belongs to the Araliaceae (ivy) family. Panax species are characterized by the presence of ginsenosides and gintonin. Panax is one of approximately 60 plant genera with a classical disjunct east Asian and east North American distribution. Furthermore, this disjunct distribution is asymmetric as only two of the ~18 species in genus are native to North America.","Apiaceae ( / e\u026a p i\u02d0 \u02c8 e\u026a s i \u02cc a\u026a, - s i\u02d0 \u02cc i\u02d0 / ) or Umbelliferae is a family of mostly aromatic flowering plants named after the type genus Apium, and commonly known as the celery, carrot or parsley family, or simply as umbellifers. It is the 16th-largest family of flowering plants, with more than 3,800 species in about 446 genera, including such well-known, and economically important plants as ajwain, angelica, anise, asafoetida, caraway, carrot, celery, chervil, coriander, cumin, dill, fennel, lovage, cow parsley, parsley, parsnip and sea holly, as well as silphium, a plant whose exact identity is unclear and may be extinct.","Sium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is widely distributed across Europe, Asia, Africa, and North America. Plants of this genus are commonly called water parsnips.","Petroselinum is a genus of two parsley species of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae, native to western and southern Europe and northern Africa.","Pastinaca (parsnips) is a genus of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae, comprising 14 species. Economically, the most important member of the genus is Pastinaca sativa, the parsnip.","Foeniculum is a genus of flowering plants in the carrot family. It includes the commonly cultivated fennel, Foeniculum vulgare.","Daucus is a worldwide genus of herbaceous plants of the celery family Apiaceae of which the best-known species is the cultivated carrot. Daucus has about 75 species. The oldest carrot fossil is 1.3 Ma, and was found on the island of Madeira in the Atlantic Ocean.","Conopodium is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae.","Bunium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae, with 45 to 50 species.","Arracacia is a genus of flowering plant in the Apiaceae. It is native to the Americas, Mexico to Bolivia. The most important member of the genus economically is the arracacha, Arracacia xanthorrhiza.","Apium is a genus, as currently circumscribed by Plants of the World Online, of 12 species of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae, with an unusual highly disjunct distribution with one species in the temperate Northern Hemisphere in the Western Palaearctic ( Europe, western Asia, north Africa ), and the rest in the temperate Southern Hemisphere in southern Africa, southern South America, Australia, and New Zealand. They are prostrate to medium-tall annual, biennial or perennial herbs growing up to 1 m high in wet soil, often marshes and salt marshes, and have pinnate to bipinnate leaves and small white flowers in compound umbels. Some species are edible, notably Apium graveolens, which is the wild ancestor of the commercially important vegetables celery, celeriac and leaf celery.","The Alismatales ( alismatids ) are an order of flowering plants including about 4,500 species. Plants assigned to this order are mostly tropical or aquatic. Some grow in fresh water, some in marine habitats. Perhaps the most important food crop in the order is the taro plant, Colocasia esculenta.","The Araceae are a family of monocotyledonous flowering plants in which flowers are borne on a type of inflorescence called a spadix. The spadix is usually accompanied by, and sometimes partially enclosed in, a spathe (or leaf-like bract ). Also known as the arum family, members are often colloquially known as aroids. This family of 114 genera and about 3,750 known species is most diverse in the New World tropics, although also distributed in the Old World tropics and northern temperate regions.","Xanthosoma is a genus of flowering plants in the arum family, Araceae. The genus is native to tropical America but widely cultivated and naturalized in other tropical regions. Several are grown for their starchy corms, an important food staple of tropical regions, known variously as malanga, otoy, otoe, cocoyam (or new cocoyam), tannia, tannier, yaut\u00eda, macabo, ocumo, macal, taioba, dasheen, quequisque, \u02bbape and (in Papua New Guinea ) as Singapore taro ( taro kongkong ). Many other species, including especially Xanthosoma roseum, are used as ornamental plants; in popular horticultural literature these species may be known as \u2018ape due to resemblance to the true Polynesian \u02bbape, Alocasia macrorrhizos, or as elephant ear from visual resemblance of the leaf to an elephant 's ear. Sometimes the latter name is also applied to members in the closely related genera Caladium, Colocasia ( taro ), and Alocasia.","Colocasia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae, native to southeastern Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Some species are widely cultivated and naturalized in other tropical and subtropical regions.","Amorphophallus (from Ancient Greek amorphos, \"without form, misshapen\" + phallos, \" penis \", referring to the shape of the prominent spadix ) is a large genus of some 200 tropical and subtropical tuberous herbaceous plants from the Arum family ( Araceae ), native to Asia, Africa, Australia and various oceanic islands. A few species are edible as \" famine foods \" after careful preparation to remove irritating chemicals. The genus includes the Titan arum ( A. titanum ) of Indonesia, which has the largest inflorescence of any plant in the genus, and is also known as the 'corpse flower' for the pungent odour it produces during its flowering period, which can take up to seven years of growth before it occurs.","The water-plantains ( Alismataceae ) are a family of flowering plants, comprising 20 genera (17 extant and 3 fossil) and 119 species. The family has a cosmopolitan distribution, with the greatest number of species in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.

Their texture and flavour are very similar to j\u00edcama, mainly differing in that yac\u00f3n has some slightly sweet, resinous, and floral (similar to violet ) undertones to its flavour, probably due to the presence of inulin, which produces the sweet taste of the roots of elecampane, as well. Another name for yac\u00f3n is Peruvian ground apple, possibly from the French name of potato, pomme de terre (ground apple). The tuber is composed mostly of water and various polysaccharides.","Pseudopodospermum hispanicum, commonly known as black salsify or Spanish salsify, also known as black oyster plant, serpent root, viper's herb, viper's grass or simply scorzonera, is a perennial species of plant in the sunflower family ( Asteraceae ), cultivated as a root vegetable in the same way as purple salsify ( Tragopogon porrifolius ), also in the sunflower family.
