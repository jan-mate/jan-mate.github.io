The order includes 68 genera and 2,600 species. Zingiberales are a unique though morphologically diverse order that has been widely recognised as such over a long period of time. They are usually large herbaceous plants with rhizomatous root systems and lacking an aerial stem except when flowering. Flowers are usually large and showy, and the stamens are often modified ( staminodes ) to also form colourful petal-like structures that attract pollinators.","Zingiberaceae ( / \u02cc z \u026a n d\u0292 \u026a b \u026a \u02c8 r e\u026a s i. i\u02d0 / ) or the ginger family is a family of flowering plants made up of about 50 genera with a total of about 1600 known species of aromatic perennial herbs with creeping horizontal or tuberous rhizomes distributed throughout tropical Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Many of the family's species are important ornamental, spice, or medicinal plants. Ornamental genera include the shell gingers ( Alpinia ), Siam or summer tulip ( Curcuma alismatifolia ), Globba, ginger lily ( Hedychium ), Kaempferia, torch-ginger Etlingera elatior, Renealmia, and ginger ( Zingiber ). Spices include ginger ( Zingiber ), galangal or Thai ginger ( Alpinia galanga and others), melegueta pepper ( Aframomum melegueta ), myoga ( Zingiber mioga ), korarima ( Aframomum corrorima ), turmeric ( Curcuma ), and cardamom ( Amomum, Elettaria ).","Zingiber is a genus of flowering plants in the family Zingiberaceae. It is native to China, the Indian Subcontinent, New Guinea, and Southeast Asia, especially Thailand. It contains the true gingers, plants grown the world over for their culinary value. The most well known species are Z. officinale and Z. mioga, two garden gingers.","Kaempferia is a genus of plants in the ginger family. It is native to China, India, and Southeast Asia.","Curcuma ( / \u02c8 k \u025c\u02d0r k j \u028a m \u0259 / ) is a genus of plants in the family Zingiberaceae that contains such species as turmeric and Siam tulip. They are native to Southeast Asia, southern China, the Indian Subcontinent, New Guinea and northern Australia.

The earliest unambiguous records of the group date to the Jurassic, and they achieved their highest diversity during the Early Cretaceous. The primary difference between gnetophytes and other gymnosperms is the presence of vessel elements, a system of small tubes ( xylem ) that transport water within the plant, similar to those found in flowering plants. Because of this, gnetophytes were once thought to be the closest gymnosperm relatives to flowering plants, but more recent molecular studies have brought this hypothesis into question, with many recent phylogenies finding them to be nested within the conifers.","Gnetum is a genus of gymnosperms, the sole genus in the family Gnetaceae within the Gnetophyta. They are tropical evergreen trees, shrubs and lianas. Unlike other gymnosperms, they possess vessel elements in the xylem. Some species have been proposed to have been the first plants to be insect- pollinated as their fossils occur in association with extinct pollinating scorpionflies. Molecular phylogenies based on nuclear and plastid sequences from most of the species indicate hybridization among some of the Southeast Asian species. Fossil-calibrated molecular-clocks suggest that the Gnetum lineages now found in Africa, South America and Southeast Asia are the result of ancient long-distance dispersal across seawater.","Gnetum is a genus of gymnosperms, the sole genus in the family Gnetaceae within the Gnetophyta.

The species are dioecious, that is, individual plants of a species are either male or female. Cycads vary in size from having trunks only a few centimeters to several meters tall. They typically grow slowly and have long lifespans. Because of their superficial resemblance to palms or ferns, they are sometimes mistaken for them, but they are not closely related to either group.\nCycads are gymnosperms (naked-seeded), meaning their unfertilized seeds are open to the air to be directly fertilized by pollination, as contrasted with angiosperms, which have enclosed seeds with more complex fertilization arrangements. Cycads have very specialized pollinators, usually a specific species of beetle. Both male and female cycads bear cones ( strobili ), somewhat similar to conifer cones.","Cycas is a genus of cycad, and the only genus in the family Cycadaceae with all other genera of cycad being divided between the Stangeriaceae and Zamiaceae families.
