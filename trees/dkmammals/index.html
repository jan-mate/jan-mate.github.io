The genus name refers to the small ears of these animals. They are stout rodents with short ears, legs and tails. They eat green vegetation such as grasses and sedges in summer, and grains, seeds, root and bark at other times. The genus is also called \"meadow voles\".","Water voles are large voles in the genus Arvicola. They are found in both aquatic and dry habitat through Europe and much of northern Asia.

The animals may exhibit indeterminate growth. They are thick-furred and have hairy fringes on their feet that improve their swimming ability.","Castoridae is a family of rodents that contains the two living species of beavers and their fossil relatives. A formerly diverse group, only a single genus is extant today, Castor. Two other genera of \"giant beavers\", Castoroides and Trogontherium, became extinct in the Late Pleistocene.","Castor most commonly refers to:","The lagomorphs ( / \u02c8 l \u00e6 \u0261 \u0259 m \u0254\u02d0 r f / ) are the members of the taxonomic order Lagomorpha, of which there are two living families: the Leporidae ( rabbits and hares ) and the Ochotonidae ( pikas ). There are 110 recent species of lagomorph, of which only 109 species in twelve genera are extant, including ten genera of rabbits (42 species); one genus of hare (33 species) and one genus of pika (34 species).

Eulipotyphla has been shown to be monophyletic; Soricomorpha is paraphyletic because both Soricidae and Talpidae share a more recent common ancestor with Erinaceidae than with solenodons.","Erinaceus is a genus of hedgehog from the family of Erinaceidae. There are four main species of Erinaceus. The range is all across Europe, throughout the Middle East, parts of Russia, and extending to northern China and Korea. The European hedgehog ( Erinaceus europaeus ) has been introduced to New Zealand.","No description available","Vespertilionidae is a family of microbats, of the order Chiroptera, flying, insect-eating mammals variously described as the common, vesper, or simple nosed bats. The vespertilionid family is the most diverse and widely distributed of bat families, specialised in many forms to occupy a range of habitats and ecological circumstances, and it is frequently observed or the subject of research. The facial features of the species are often simple, as they mainly rely on vocally emitted echolocation. The tails of the species are enclosed by the lower flight membranes between the legs. Over 300 species are distributed all over the world, on every continent except Antarctica. It owes its name to the genus Vespertilio, which takes its name from a word for bat, vespertilio, derived from the Latin term vesper meaning 'evening'; they are termed \"evening bats\" and were once referred to as \"evening birds\". (The term \"evening bat\" also often refers more specifically to one of the species, Nycticeius humeralis.)","Vespertilio is a genus of bats in the family Vespertilionidae. The common name for this family is vesper bats, which is a better-known classification than Vespertilio. They are also known as frosted bats.","Plecotus is a genus of vesper bat, commonly called long-eared bats. They are found throughout Eurasia and northern Africa. Many species in the genus have only been described and recognized in recent years.","Pipistrellus is a genus of bats in the family Vespertilionidae and subfamily Vespertilioninae. The name of the genus is derived from the Italian word pipistrello, meaning \"bat\" (from Latin vespertilio \"bird of evening, bat\").","Nyctalus is a genus of vespertilionid bats commonly known as the noctule bats. They are distributed in the temperate and subtropical areas of Europe, Asia and North Africa.","The mouse-eared bats or myotises are a diverse and widespread genus ( Myotis ) of bats within the family Vespertilionidae. The noun \" myotis \" itself is a Neo-Latin construction, from the Greek \" mu\u00f3s (meaning \"mouse\") and \" o\u00fbs \" (meaning ear), literally translating to \"mouse-eared\".","Eptesicus is a genus of bats, commonly called house bats or serotine bats, in the family Vespertilionidae. The genus name is likely derived from the Greek words ptetikos 'able to fly' or petomai 'house flier', although this is not certain.","Barbastella is a genus of vespertilionid bats. There are seven extant species in this genus and one only known from fossil remains.","Carnivora ( / k \u0251\u02d0r \u02c8 n \u026a v \u0259r \u0259 / kar- NIH -v\u0259r-\u0259 ) is an order of placental mammals specialized primarily in eating flesh, whose members are formally referred to as carnivorans. The order Carnivora is the sixth largest order of mammals, comprising at least 279 species on every major landmass and in a variety of habitats, ranging from the cold polar regions of Earth to the hyper-arid region of the Sahara Desert and the open seas. Carnivorans exhibit a wide array of body plans, varying greatly in size and shape.","Procyonidae ( / \u02cc p r o\u028a s i\u02d0 \u02c8 \u0252 n \u026a d i\u02d0 / PROH -see- ON -i-dee ) is a New World family of the order Carnivora. It includes the raccoons, ringtails, cacomistles, coatis, kinkajous, olingos, and olinguitos. Procyonids inhabit a wide range of environments and are generally omnivorous.","No description available","The earless seals, phocids, or true seals are one of the three main groups of mammals within the seal lineage, Pinnipedia. All true seals are members of the family Phocidae ( / \u02c8 f o\u028a s \u026a d i\u02d0 / ). They are sometimes called crawling seals to distinguish them from the fur seals and sea lions of the family Otariidae. Seals live in the oceans of both hemispheres and, with the exception of the more tropical monk seals, are mostly confined to polar, subpolar, and temperate climates. The Baikal seal is the only species of exclusively freshwater seal.","Pusa is a genus of the earless seals, within the family Phocidae. The three species of this genus were split from the genus Phoca, and some sources still give Phoca as an acceptable synonym for Pusa.","Phoca ( / \u02c8 f o\u028a k \u0259 / FOH -k\u0259 ) is a genus of the earless seals, within the family Phocidae. It now contains just two species, the common seal (or harbour seal) and the spotted seal (or largha seal). Several species formerly listed under this genus have been split into the genera Pusa, Pagophilus, and Histriophoca. Until recently, Phoca largha has been considered a subspecies of Phoca vitulina but now is considered its own species. For this reason, the fossil history of the genus is unclear, and it has formerly been used as wastebasket taxon for a number of fossils of uncertain affinity.","The harp seal ( Pagophilus groenlandicus ), also known as Saddleback Seal or Greenland Seal, is a species of earless seal, or true seal, native to the northernmost Atlantic Ocean and Arctic Ocean. Originally in the genus Phoca with a number of other species, it was reclassified into the monotypic genus Pagophilus in 1844. In Greek, its scientific name translates to \"ice-lover from Greenland,\" and its taxonomic synonym, Phoca groenlandica translates to \"Greenlandic seal.\" This is the only species in the genus Pagophilus.","The grey seal ( Halichoerus grypus ) is a large seal of the family Phocidae, which are commonly referred to as \"true seals\" or \"earless seals\". The only species classified in the genus Halichoerus, it is found on both shores of the North Atlantic Ocean. In Latin, Halichoerus grypus means \"hook-nosed sea pig\". Its name is spelled gray seal in the United States; it is also known as Atlantic seal and the horsehead seal.","Cystophora may refer to:","Odobenidae is a family of pinnipeds, of which the only extant species is the walrus ( Odobenus rosmarus ). In the past, however, the group was much more diverse, and includes more than a dozen fossil genera.","No description available","The Mustelidae ( / m \u028c \u02c8 s t \u025b l \u026a d i\u02d0 /; from Latin mustela, weasel) are a diverse family of carnivoran mammals, including weasels, badgers, otters, polecats, martens, grisons, and wolverines. Otherwise known as mustelids ( / \u02c8 m \u028c s t \u026a l \u026a d z / ), they form the largest family in the suborder Caniformia of the order Carnivora with about 66 to 70 species in nine subfamilies.","A marten is a weasel -like mammal in the genus Martes within the subfamily Guloninae, in the family Mustelidae. They have bushy tails and large paws with partially retractile claws. The fur varies from yellowish to dark brown, depending on the species; it is valued by animal trappers for the fur trade. Martens are slender, agile animals, which are adapted to living in the taiga, and inhabit coniferous and northern deciduous forests across the Northern Hemisphere.","Neogale (colloquially referred to as the New World weasels ) is a genus of carnivorous, highly active small mammals belonging to the Mustelidae family (which also contains badgers, weasels, martens, otters, and wolverines, among others). Neogale contains four species: the Amazon weasel ( Neogale africana ), the long and short-tailed weasels ( N. frenata and N. lontra ), and the American mink ( N. vison ). Native to the Americas, members of the genus can be found as far north as Alaska and as far south as Argentina and Bolivia. Across this distribution, they thrive in a range of habitats, from the deep-freezes of the Alaskan and Canadian boreal forests to the arid desert southwest, and from the humid tropics of Central and South America (including the Amazon basin ) to the windswept foothills of the Andes and northern Patagonia.","No description available","Meles may refer to:","Lutra is a genus of otters, one of seven in the subfamily Lutrinae.","No description available","Vulpes is a genus of the sub-family Caninae. The members of this genus are colloquially referred to as true foxes, meaning they form a proper clade. The word \" fox \" occurs in the common names of all species of the genus, but also appears in the common names of other canid species. True foxes are distinguished from members of the genus Canis, such as domesticated dogs, wolves, jackals and coyotes, by their smaller size (5\u201311\u00a0kg), longer, bushier tail, and flatter skull. They have black, triangular markings between their eyes and nose, and the tip of their tail is often a different color from the rest of their pelt. The typical lifespan for this genus is between two and four years, but can reach up to a decade.","Nyctereutes (Greek: nyx, nykt- \"night\" + ereut\u0113s \"wanderer\") is a genus of canid which includes only two extant species, both known as raccoon dogs: the common raccoon dog ( Nyctereutes procyonoides ) and the Japanese raccoon dog ( Nyctereutes viverrinus ). Nyctereutes first entered the fossil record 5.5 million years ago ( Mya ) in northern China. It was one of the earliest canines to arrive in the Old World. All but two species became extinct before the end of the Pleistocene. A study suggests that the evolution of Nyctereutes was influenced by environmental and climatic changes, such as the expansion and contraction of forests and the fluctuations of temperature and precipitation.","Canis is a genus of the Caninae which includes multiple extant species, such as wolves, dogs, coyotes, and golden jackals. Species of this genus are distinguished by their moderate to large size, their massive, well-developed skulls and dentition, long legs, and comparatively short ears and tails.","Artiodactyls are placental mammals belonging to the order Artiodactyla ( / \u02cc \u0251\u02d0r t i o\u028a \u02c8 d \u00e6 k t \u026a l \u0259 / AR -tee-oh- DAK -tih-l\u0259, from Ancient Greek \u1f04\u03c1\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, \u00e1rtios 'even' and \u03b4\u03ac\u03ba\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, d\u00e1ktylos 'finger, toe'). Typically, they are ungulates which bear weight equally on two (an even number) of their five toes (the third and fourth, often in the form of a hoof ). The other three toes are either present, absent, vestigial, or pointing posteriorly. By contrast, most perissodactyls bear weight on an odd number of the five toes. Another difference between the two orders is that many artiodactyls (except for Suina ) digest plant cellulose in one or more stomach chambers rather than in their intestine (as perissodactyls do). Molecular biology, along with new fossil discoveries, has found that cetaceans ( whales, dolphins, and porpoises ) fall within this taxonomic branch, being most closely related to hippopotamuses. Some modern taxonomists thus apply the name Cetartiodactyla ( / s \u026a \u02cc t \u0251\u02d0r t i o\u028a \u02c8 d \u00e6 k t \u026a l \u0259 / ) to this group, while others opt to include cetaceans within the existing name of Artiodactyla. Some researchers use \" even-toed ungulates \" to exclude cetaceans and only include terrestrial artiodactyls, making the term paraphyletic in nature.","No description available","Phocoena is a genus of porpoises with four extant species.","Beaked whales ( systematic name Ziphiidae ) are a family of cetaceans noted as being one of the least-known groups of mammals because of their deep-sea habitat, reclusive behavior and apparent low abundance. Only three or four of the 24 existing species are reasonably well-known. Baird's beaked whales and Cuvier's beaked whales were subject to commercial exploitation, off the coast of Japan, while the northern bottlenose whale was extensively hunted in the northern part of the North Atlantic in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.","Cuvier's beaked whale, goose-beaked whale, or ziphius ( Ziphius cavirostris ) is the most widely distributed of all beaked whales in the family Ziphiidae. It is smaller than most baleen whales \u2014and indeed the larger toothed cetaceans (like orca and sperm whales )\u2014yet it is large among the beaked whales and smaller cetaceans, appearing somewhat like a bigger and stockier bottlenose dolphin. Cuvier's beaked whale is pelagic, generally inhabiting waters deeper than 300\u00a0m (1,000\u00a0ft), though it has been observed closer to shore on occasion. In these offshore waters, Cuvier's beaked whales execute some of the deepest and longest recorded dives among whales, and extant mammals. The current published records are 2,992\u00a0m (9,816\u00a0ft) for dive depth and 222 minutes for dive duration as recorded by biologging instruments attached to individual whales. While likely diving to forage and hunt prey, such as cephalopods, and potentially evade predators (like the aforementioned orca), the frequency and exact reason for these extraordinary dives is unclear. Despite its deepwater habitat, it is one of the most frequently-spotted beaked whales when surfacing.","Mesoplodont whales are 16 species of toothed whale in the genus Mesoplodon, making it the largest genus in the cetacean order. Two species were described as recently as 1991 (pygmy beaked whale) and 2002 (Perrin's beaked whale), and marine biologists predict the discovery of more species in the future. A new species was described in 2021. They are the most poorly known group of large mammals. The generic name \"mesoplodon\" comes from the Greek meso - (middle) - hopla (arms) - odon (teeth), and may be translated as 'armed with a tooth in the centre of the jaw'.","Hyperoodon (or Hypero\u00f6don ) is a genus of beaked whale, containing just two species: the Northern and Southern bottlenose whales. While not in the genus Hyperoodon, Longman's beaked whales are alternatively called tropical bottlenose whales due to their physical features resembling those of bottlenose whales.","Suidae is a family of artiodactyl mammals which are commonly called pigs, hogs, or swine. In addition to numerous fossil species, 18 extant species are currently recognized (or 19 counting domestic pigs and wild boars separately), classified into between four and eight genera. Within this family, the genus Sus includes the domestic pig, Sus scrofa domesticus or Sus domesticus, and many species of wild pig from Europe to the Pacific. Other genera include babirusas and warthogs. All suids, or swine, are native to the Old World, ranging from Asia to Europe and Africa.","No description available","Physeteroidea is a superfamily that includes three extant species of whales: the sperm whale, in the genus Physeter, and the pygmy sperm whale and dwarf sperm whale, in the genus Kogia. In the past, these genera have sometimes been united in a single family, the Physeteridae, with the two Kogia species in the subfamily Kogiinae; however, recent practice is to allocate the genus Kogia to its own family, the Kogiidae, leaving the Physeteridae as a monotypic (single extant species) family, although additional fossil representatives of both families are known.","Physeter is a genus of toothed whales. There is only one living species in this genus: the sperm whale ( Physeter macrocephalus ). Some extremely poorly known fossil species have also been assigned to the same genus including Physeter antiquus (5.3\u20132.6 mya) from the Pliocene of France, and Physeter vetus (2.6 mya \u2013 12 ka) from the Quaternary of the U.S. state of Georgia. Physeter vetus is very likely an invalid species, as the few teeth that were used to identify this species appear to be identical to those of another toothed whale, Orycterocetus quadratidens.","The cetacean family Monodontidae comprises two living whale species, the narwhal and the beluga whale and at least four extinct species, known from the fossil record. Beluga and Narwhal are native to coastal regions and pack ice around the Arctic Ocean. Both species are relatively small whales, 3\u20135\u00a0m (9.8\u201316.4\u00a0ft) in length, with a forehead melon, and a short or absent snout. Premaxillary teeth are absent. They do not have a true dorsal fin, but do have a narrow ridge running along the back, which is much more pronounced in the narwhal. They are highly vocal animals, communicating with a wide range of sounds. Like other whales, they also use echolocation to navigate. Belugas can be found in the far north of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans; the distribution of narwhals is restricted to the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans.","No description available","Oceanic dolphins or Delphinidae are a widely distributed family of dolphins that live in the sea. Close to forty extant species are recognised. They include several big species whose common names contain \"whale\" rather than \"dolphin\", such as the Globicephalinae (round-headed whales, which include the false killer whale and pilot whale ).

red squirrel ( Sciurus vulgaris ), also called Eurasian red squirrel, is a species of tree squirrel in the genus Sciurus. It is an arboreal and primarily herbivorous rodent and common throughout Eurasia.","The Siberian chipmunk ( Eutamias sibiricus ), also called common chipmunk, is one of the genera of chipmunk native to northern Asia from central Russia to China, Korea, and Hokkaid\u014d in northern Japan. It was imported from South Korea and introduced in Europe as a pet in the 1960s.","The black rat ( Rattus rattus ), also known as the roof rat, ship rat, or house rat, is a common long-tailed rodent of the stereotypical rat genus Rattus, in the subfamily Murinae. It likely originated in the Indian subcontinent, but is now found worldwide.","The brown rat ( Rattus norvegicus ), also known as the common rat, street rat, sewer rat, wharf rat, Hanover rat, Norway rat and Norwegian rat, is a widespread species of common rat. One of the largest muroids, it is a brown or grey rodent with a body length of up to 28\u00a0cm (11\u00a0in) long, and a tail slightly shorter than that. It weighs between 140 and 500\u00a0g (4.9 and 17.6\u00a0oz). Thought to have originated in northern China and neighbouring areas, this rodent has now spread to all continents except Antarctica, and is the dominant rat in Europe and much of North America. With rare exceptions, the brown rat lives wherever humans live, particularly in urban areas.","The house mouse ( Mus musculus ) is a small mammal of the order Rodentia, characteristically having a pointed snout, large rounded ears, and a long and almost hairless tail. It is one of the most abundant species of the genus Mus. Although a wild animal, the house mouse has benefited significantly from associating with human habitation to the point that truly wild populations are significantly less common than the semi-tame populations near human activity.","The harvest mouse ( Micromys minutus ) is a small rodent native to Europe and Asia. It is typically found in fields of cereal crops, such as wheat and oats, in reed beds and in other tall ground vegetation, such as long grass and hedgerows. It has reddish-brown fur with white underparts and a naked, highly prehensile tail, which it uses for climbing. It is the smallest European rodent; an adult may weigh as little as 4 grams (0.14\u00a0oz). It eats chiefly seeds and insects, but also nectar and fruit. Breeding nests are spherical constructions carefully woven from grass and attached to stems well above the ground.","The wood mouse ( Apodemus sylvaticus ) is a murid rodent native to Europe and northwestern Africa. It is closely related to the yellow-necked mouse ( Apodemus flavicollis ) but differs in that it has no band of yellow fur around the neck, has slightly smaller ears, and is usually slightly smaller overall: around 90\u00a0mm (3.54\u00a0in) in length and 23 g in weight. It is found across most of Europe and is a very common and widespread species, is commensal with people and is sometimes considered a pest. Other common names are long-tailed field mouse, field mouse, common field mouse, and European wood mouse. This species is a known potential carrier of the Dobrava sequence of hantavirus which affects humans and may pose serious risks to human health.","The yellow-necked mouse ( Apodemus flavicollis ), also called yellow-necked field mouse, yellow-necked wood mouse, and South China field mouse, is closely related to the wood mouse, with which it was long confused. It was only recognised as a separate species in 1894. It differs in its band of yellow fur around the neck and in having slightly larger ears and usually being slightly larger overall. Around 100\u00a0mm in length, it can climb trees and sometimes overwinters in houses. It is found mostly in mountainous areas of southern Europe, but extends north into parts of Scandinavia and Britain. It facilitates the spread of tick-borne encephalitis to humans and is a reservoir species for the Dobrava virus, a hantavirus that is responsible for causing haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.","The striped field mouse ( Apodemus agrarius ) is a rodent in the family Muridae. The range of this species stretches from Eastern Europe to Eastern Asia.","The hazel dormouse or common dormouse ( Muscardinus avellanarius ) is a small dormouse species native to Europe and the only living species in the genus Muscardinus.","The garden dormouse ( Eliomys quercinus ) is a species of dormouse native to Europe.","The nutria ( / \u02c8 n ju\u02d0 t r i \u0259 / ) or coypu ( / \u02c8 k \u0254\u026a p u\u02d0 / ) ( Myocastor coypus ) is a herbivorous, semiaquatic rodent from South America.\nClassified for a long time as the only member of the family Myocastoridae, Myocastor has since been included within Echimyidae, the family of the spiny rats. The nutria lives in burrows alongside stretches of water and feeds on river plant stems. Originally native to subtropical and temperate South America, it was introduced to North America, Europe and Asia, primarily by fur farmers. Although it is still hunted and trapped for its fur in some regions, its destructive burrowing and feeding habits often bring it into conflict with humans, and it is considered an invasive species in the United States. Nutria also transmit various diseases to humans and animals, mainly through water contamination.","The northern birch mouse ( Sicista betulina ) is a small rodent about 5 to 8\u00a0cm long (without the tail), weighing 5 to 13 g. It lives in northern Europe and Asia in forest and marsh zones.","The bank vole ( Clethrionomys glareolus ) is a small vole with red-brown fur and some grey patches, with a tail about half as long as its body. A rodent, it lives in woodland areas and is around 100 millimetres (3.9\u00a0in) in length. The bank vole is found in much of Europe and in northwestern Asia. It is native to Great Britain but not to Ireland, where it has been accidentally introduced, and has now colonised much of the south and southwest.","No description available","The common vole ( Microtus arvalis ) is a European rodent.","The short-tailed field vole, short-tailed vole, or simply field vole ( Microtus agrestis ) is a grey-brown vole, around 10\u00a0cm in length, with a short tail. It is one of the most common mammals in Europe, with a range extending from the Atlantic coast to Lake Baikal. These voles are found in moist grassy habitats, such as woodland, marsh or on river banks. Although they make shallow burrows, they usually build nests above ground. They are an important food source for owls and some other predators and their population size tends to peak and trough cyclically. Field voles breed prolifically, mainly in summer, but often all year round, even under snow. Females produce up to seven litters a year, each averaging from four to six young which are weaned after about fourteen days. The short-tailed field vole is both widespread and common and is listed as being of \" Least Concern \" by the IUCN.","The European water vole ( Arvicola amphibius ) or northern water vole is a semi-aquatic rodent. It is often informally called the water rat, though it only superficially resembles a true rat. Water voles have rounder noses than rats, deep brown fur, chubby faces and short fuzzy ears; unlike rats their tails, paws and ears are covered with hair.","No description available","The European rabbit ( Oryctolagus cuniculus ) or coney is a species of rabbit native to the Iberian Peninsula ( Spain, Portugal and Andorra ) and southwestern France. It is the only extant species in the genus Oryctolagus. The European rabbit has faced a population decline in its native range due to myxomatosis, rabbit hemorrhagic disease, overhunting and habitat loss. Outside of its native range, it is known as an invasive species, as it has been introduced to countries on all continents with the exception of Antarctica, often with devastating effects on local biodiversity due to a lack of predators.","No description available","The European mole ( Talpa europaea ) is a mammal of the order Eulipotyphla. It is also known as the common mole and the northern mole.","The Eurasian pygmy shrew ( Sorex minutus ), often known simply as the pygmy shrew, is a widespread shrew of the northern Palearctic.","The common shrew ( Sorex araneus ), also known as the Eurasian shrew, is the most common shrew, and one of the most common mammals, throughout Northern Europe, including Great Britain, but excluding Ireland. It is 55 to 82 millimetres (2.2 to 3.2\u00a0in) long and weighs 5 to 12 grams (0.2 to 0.4\u00a0oz), and has velvety dark brown fur with a pale underside. It is one of the rare venomous mammals. Juvenile shrews have lighter fur until their first moult. The common shrew has small eyes, a pointed, mobile snout and red-tipped teeth. It has a life span of approximately 14 months.","The Eurasian water shrew ( Neomys fodiens ), known in the United Kingdom as the water shrew, is a relatively large shrew, up to 10\u00a0cm (4\u00a0in) long, with a tail up to three-quarters as long again. It has short, dark fur, often with a few white tufts, a white belly, and a few stiff hairs around the feet and tail. It lives close to fresh water, hunting aquatic prey in the water and nearby. Its fur traps bubbles of air in the water which greatly aids its buoyancy, but requires it to anchor itself to remain underwater for more than the briefest of dives.","The European hedgehog ( Erinaceus europaeus ), also known as the West European hedgehog or common hedgehog, is a hedgehog species native to Europe from Iberia and Italy northwards into Scandinavia and westwards into the British Isles. It is a generally common and widely distributed species that can survive across a wide range of habitat types. It is a well-known species, and a favourite in European gardens, both for its endearing appearance and its preference for eating a range of garden pests. While populations are currently stable across much of its range, it is declining severely in Great Britain where it is now Red Listed, meaning that it is considered to be at risk of local extinction. Outside its native range, the species was introduced to New Zealand during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.","The parti-coloured bat or rearmouse ( Vespertilio murinus ) is a species of vesper bat that lives in temperate Eurasia, from Western and Southern Europe, eastwards over the Caucasus and Iran into Mongolia, north-east China, Korea, Afghanistan and northern Pakistan.","The grey long-eared bat ( Plecotus austriacus ) is a fairly large European bat. It has distinctive ears, long and with a distinctive fold. It hunts above woodland, often by day, and mostly for moths. In captivity, it has also been recorded to eat small lizards. It is extremely similar to the more common brown long-eared bat, and was only distinguished in the 1960s, but has a paler belly.","The brown long-eared bat or common long-eared bat ( Plecotus auritus ) is a small Eurasian insectivorous bat. It has distinctive ears, long and with a distinctive fold. It is extremely similar to the much rarer grey long-eared bat which was only validated as a distinct species in the 1960s. An adult brown long-eared bat has a body length of 4.5\u20134.8\u00a0cm, a tail of 4.1\u20134.6\u00a0cm, and a forearm length of 4\u20134.2\u00a0cm. The ears are 3.3\u20133.9\u00a0cm in length, and readily distinguish the long-eared bats from most other bat species. They are relatively slow flyers compared to other bat species.","The soprano pipistrelle ( Pipistrellus pygmaeus ) is a small species of bat. It is found in Europe and often roosts on buildings.","The common pipistrelle ( Pipistrellus pipistrellus ) is a small pipistrelle microbat whose very large range extends across most of Europe, North Africa, South Asia, and may extend into Korea. It is one of the most common bat species in the British Isles. In Europe, the northernmost confirmed records are from southern Finland near 60\u00b0N.","Nathusius' pipistrelle ( Pipistrellus nathusii ) is a small bat in the genus Pipistrellus. It is very similar to the common pipistrelle and has been overlooked in many areas until recently but it is widely distributed across Europe. It was described by two German naturalists, Alexander Keyserling and Johann Heinrich Blasius, and named by them after Hermann von Nathusius, in gratitude for his support of their research.","The common noctule ( Nyctalus noctula ) is a species of insectivorous bat common throughout Europe, Asia, and North Africa.","The lesser noctule, Leisler's bat or the Irish bat ( Nyctalus leisleri ), is a species of insectivorous bat belonging to the vesper bat family, Vespertilionidae. The species was named to honour the naturalist Johann Philipp Achilles Leisler.","Natterer's bat ( Myotis nattereri ) is a European vespertilionid bat with pale wings. It has brown fur tending to greyish-white on its underside. It is found across most of the continent of Europe, parts of the Near East and North Africa. It feeds on insects and other invertebrates which it catches on the wing or pursues on the ground.","The whiskered bat ( Myotis mystacinus ) is a small European bat with long fur. Although uncommon, M. mystacinus is often found around human habitation and around water; it is similar to Brandt's bat ( Myotis brandtii ), from which it was distinguished as a separate species only in 1970.","The greater mouse-eared bat ( Myotis myotis ) is a European species of bat in the family Vespertilionidae.","Daubenton's bat or Daubenton's myotis ( Myotis daubentonii ) is a Eurasian bat with rather short ears. It ranges from Ireland to Japan ( Hokkaido ) and is considered to be increasing its numbers in many areas.","The pond bat ( Myotis dasycneme ) is a species of vesper bat.

It has a wingspan of around 37\u00a0cm (15\u00a0in) and often hunts in woodland. It sometimes roosts in buildings, hanging upside down, in small groups or individually. The name serotine is derived from the Latin serotinus, which means 'evening', while the generic name derives from Greek \u1f14\u03c0\u03b9\u03b5\u03bd and \u03bf\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, which means 'house flyer'.","The northern bat ( Eptesicus nilssonii ) is the most abundant species of bat in northern Eurasia occurring from France to Hokkaid\u014d and south to Kazakhstan.","The western barbastelle ( Barbastella barbastellus ), also known as the barbastelle or barbastelle bat, is a European bat in the genus Barbastella. This species is found from Portugal to Azerbaijan and from Sweden to Canary Islands, where a sub-species was identified. It has a short nose, small eyes and wide ears. The conservation status of B. barbastellus is assessed as \"near threatened\", \"vulnerable\", \"critically endangered\" or \"extinct\" in various parts of its range.","No description available","The ringed seal ( Pusa hispida ) is an earless seal inhabiting the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. The ringed seal is a relatively small seal, rarely greater than 1.5 metres (5\u00a0ft) in length, with a distinctive patterning of dark spots surrounded by light gray rings, hence its common name. It is the most abundant and wide-ranging ice seal in the Northern Hemisphere, ranging throughout the Arctic Ocean, into the Bering Sea and Okhotsk Sea as far south as the northern coast of Japan in the Pacific and throughout the North Atlantic coasts of Greenland and Scandinavia as far south as Newfoundland, and including two freshwater subspecies in northern Europe. Ringed seals are one of the primary prey of polar bears and killer whales, and have long been a component of the diet of indigenous people of the Arctic.","The harbor (or harbour ) seal ( Phoca vitulina ), also known as the common seal, is a true seal found along temperate and Arctic marine coastlines of the Northern Hemisphere. The most widely distributed species of pinniped (walruses, eared seals, and true seals), they are found in coastal waters of the northern Atlantic and Pacific oceans, Baltic and North seas.","The harp seal ( Pagophilus groenlandicus ), also known as Saddleback Seal or Greenland Seal, is a species of earless seal, or true seal, native to the northernmost Atlantic Ocean and Arctic Ocean. Originally in the genus Phoca with a number of other species, it was reclassified into the monotypic genus Pagophilus in 1844. In Greek, its scientific name translates to \"ice-lover from Greenland,\" and its taxonomic synonym, Phoca groenlandica translates to \"Greenlandic seal.\" This is the only species in the genus Pagophilus.","The grey seal ( Halichoerus grypus ) is a large seal of the family Phocidae, which are commonly referred to as \"true seals\" or \"earless seals\". The only species classified in the genus Halichoerus, it is found on both shores of the North Atlantic Ocean. In Latin, Halichoerus grypus means \"hook-nosed sea pig\". Its name is spelled gray seal in the United States; it is also known as Atlantic seal and the horsehead seal.","The hooded seal or bladdernose seal ( Cystophora cristata ) is a large phocid found only in the central and western North Atlantic, ranging from Svalbard in the east to the Gulf of St. Lawrence in the west. The seals are typically silver-grey or white in color, with black spots that vary in size covering most of the body. Hooded seal pups are known as \"blue-backs\" because their coats are blue-grey on the back with whitish bellies. This coat is shed after 14 months of age when the pups molt. It is the only species in the genus Cystophora.","No description available","The European pine marten ( Martes martes ), also known as the pine marten, is a mustelid native to and widespread in most of Europe, Asia Minor, the Caucasus and parts of Iran, Iraq and Syria. It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. It is less commonly also known as baum marten or sweet marten.","The beech marten ( Martes foina ), also known as the stone marten, house marten or white breasted marten, is a species of marten native to much of Europe and Central Asia, though it has established a feral population in North America. It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List on account of its wide distribution, its large population, and its presence in a number of protected areas. It is superficially similar to the European pine marten, but differs from it by its smaller size and habitat preferences. While the pine marten is a forest specialist, the beech marten is a more generalist and adaptable species, occurring in a number of open and forest habitats.","The American mink ( Neogale vison ) is a semiaquatic species of mustelid native to North America, though human introduction has expanded its range to many parts of Europe, Asia, and South America. Because of range expansion, the American mink is classed as a least-concern species by the IUCN. The American mink was formerly thought to be the only extant member of the genus Neovison following the extinction of the sea mink ( N.\u00a0macrodon ), but recent studies, followed by taxonomic authorities, have reclassified it and the sea mink within the genus Neogale, which also contains a few New World weasel species. The American mink is a carnivore that feeds on rodents, fish, crustaceans, frogs, and birds. In its introduced range in Europe it has been classified as an invasive species linked to declines in European mink, Pyrenean desman, and water vole populations. It is the animal most frequently farmed for its fur, exceeding the silver fox, sable, marten, and skunk in economic importance.","No description available","No description available","The stoat ( Mustela erminea ), also known as the Eurasian ermine or ermine, is a species of mustelid native to Eurasia and the northern regions of North America. Because of its wide circumpolar distribution, it is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. The name ermine ( / \u02c8 \u025c\u02d0r m \u026a n / ) is used especially in its pure white winter coat of the stoat or its fur. Ermine fur was used in the 15th century by Catholic monarchs, who sometimes used it as the mozzetta cape. It has long been used on the ceremonial robes of members of the United Kingdom House of Lords. It was also used in capes on images such as the Infant Jesus of Prague.","The European badger ( Meles meles ), also known as the Eurasian badger, is a badger species in the family Mustelidae native to Europe and West Asia and parts of Central Asia. It is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List, as it has a wide range and a large, stable population size which is thought to be increasing in some regions. Several subspecies are recognized, with the nominate subspecies ( M. m. meles ) predominating in most of Europe. In Europe, where no other badger species commonly occurs, it is generally just called the \" badger \".","The Eurasian otter ( Lutra lutra ), also known as the European otter, Eurasian river otter, European river otter, common otter, and Old World otter, is a semiaquatic mammal native to Eurasia and the Maghreb. The most widely distributed member of the otter subfamily (Lutrinae) of the weasel family (Mustelidae), it is found in the waterways and coasts of Europe, many parts of Asia, and parts of northern Africa. The Eurasian otter has a diet mainly of fish, and is strongly territorial. It is endangered in some parts of its range, but is recovering in others.","No description available","Nyctereutes (Greek: nyx, nykt- \"night\" + ereut\u0113s \"wanderer\") is a genus of canid which includes only two extant species, both known as raccoon dogs: the common raccoon dog ( Nyctereutes procyonoides ) and the Japanese raccoon dog ( Nyctereutes viverrinus ). Nyctereutes first entered the fossil record 5.5 million years ago ( Mya ) in northern China. It was one of the earliest canines to arrive in the Old World. All but two species became extinct before the end of the Pleistocene. A study suggests that the evolution of Nyctereutes was influenced by environmental and climatic changes, such as the expansion and contraction of forests and the fluctuations of temperature and precipitation.","No description available","No description available","The harbour porpoise ( Phocoena phocoena ) is one of eight extant species of porpoise. It is one of the smallest species of cetacean. As its name implies, it stays close to coastal areas or river estuaries, and as such, is the most familiar porpoise to whale watchers. This porpoise often ventures up rivers, and has been seen hundreds of kilometres from the sea. The harbour porpoise may be polytypic, with geographically distinct populations representing distinct races: P. p. phocoena in the North Atlantic and West Africa, P. p. relicta in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, an unnamed population in the northwestern Pacific and P. p. vomerina in the northeastern Pacific.","Cuvier's beaked whale, goose-beaked whale, or ziphius ( Ziphius cavirostris ) is the most widely distributed of all beaked whales in the family Ziphiidae. It is smaller than most baleen whales \u2014and indeed the larger toothed cetaceans (like orca and sperm whales )\u2014yet it is large among the beaked whales and smaller cetaceans, appearing somewhat like a bigger and stockier bottlenose dolphin. Cuvier's beaked whale is pelagic, generally inhabiting waters deeper than 300\u00a0m (1,000\u00a0ft), though it has been observed closer to shore on occasion. In these offshore waters, Cuvier's beaked whales execute some of the deepest and longest recorded dives among whales, and extant mammals. The current published records are 2,992\u00a0m (9,816\u00a0ft) for dive depth and 222 minutes for dive duration as recorded by biologging instruments attached to individual whales. While likely diving to forage and hunt prey, such as cephalopods, and potentially evade predators (like the aforementioned orca), the frequency and exact reason for these extraordinary dives is unclear. Despite its deepwater habitat, it is one of the most frequently-spotted beaked whales when surfacing.","Sowerby's beaked whale ( Mesoplodon bidens ), also known as the North Atlantic or North Sea beaked whale, is a species of toothed whale. It was the first mesoplodont whale to be described. James Sowerby, an English naturalist and artist, first described the species in 1804 from a skull obtained from a male that had stranded in the Moray Firth, Scotland, in 1800. He named it bidens, which derives from the two teeth present in the jaw, now known to be a very common feature among the genus.","The northern bottlenose whale ( Hyperoodon ampullatus ) is a species of beaked whale in the ziphiid family, being one of two members of the genus Hyperoodon. The northern bottlenose whale was hunted heavily by Norway and Britain in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It is one of the deepest-diving mammals known, reaching depths of 2,339\u00a0m (7,674\u00a0ft) and capable of diving for up to 130 minutes.","The wild boar ( Sus scrofa ), also known as the wild swine, common wild pig, Eurasian wild pig, or simply wild pig, is a suid native to much of Eurasia and North Africa, and has been introduced to the Americas and Oceania. The species is now one of the widest-ranging mammals in the world, as well as the most widespread suiform. It has been assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List due to its wide range, high numbers, and adaptability to a diversity of habitats. It has become an invasive species in part of its introduced range. Wild boars probably originated in Southeast Asia during the Early Pleistocene and outcompeted other suid species as they spread throughout the Old World.","No description available","No description available","The long-finned pilot whale, or pothead whale ( Globicephala melas ) is a large species of oceanic dolphin. It shares the genus Globicephala with the short-finned pilot whale ( Globicephala macrorhynchus ).

Some of the most closely related species to these dolphins include: pilot whales ( Globicephala spp.), pygmy killer whales ( Feresa attenuata ), melon-headed whales ( Peponocephala electra ), and false killer whales ( Pseudorca crassidens ). These dolphins grow to be about 10 ft in length and can be identified by heavy scarring that appears white. They are located worldwide in cold to temperate waters, but most typically found along continental shelves due to their eating habits. Risso's dolphins have a diet that contains primarily cephalopods. They are able to search for prey at various depths due to their ability to reach depths of almost 600m. Individuals typically travel in pods ranging anywhere from 10 to 50 dolphins, with which they form tight social bonds.","The common dolphin ( Delphinus delphis ) is the most abundant cetacean in the world, with a global population of about six million. Despite this fact and its vernacular name, the common dolphin is not thought of as the archetypal dolphin, with that distinction belonging to the bottlenose dolphin due to its popular appearances in aquaria and the media. However, the common dolphin is often depicted in Ancient Greek and Roman art and culture, most notably in a mural painted by the Greek Minoan civilization.","The European fallow deer ( Dama dama ), also known as the common fallow deer or simply fallow deer, is a species of deer native to Eurasia. It is one of two living species of fallow deer alongside the Persian fallow deer ( Dama mesapotamica ). It is historically native to Turkey and possibly the Italian Peninsula, Balkan Peninsula, and the island of Rhodes near Anatolia. During the Pleistocene it inhabited much of Europe, and has been reintroduced to its prehistoric distribution by humans. It has also been introduced to other regions in the world.","The sika deer ( Cervus nippon ), also known as the northern spotted deer or the Japanese deer, is a species of deer native to much of East Asia and introduced to other parts of the world. Previously found from northern Vietnam in the south to the Russian Far East in the north, it was hunted to the brink of extinction in the 19th century. Protection laws were enacted in the mid-20th century, leading to a rapid recovery of their population from the 1950s to the 1980s.","The red deer ( Cervus elaphus ) is one of the largest deer species. A male red deer is called a stag or hart, and a female is called a doe or hind. The red deer inhabits most of Europe, the Caucasus Mountains region, Anatolia, Iran, and parts of western Asia. It also inhabits the Atlas Mountains of Northern Africa; being the only living species of deer to inhabit Africa. Red deer have been introduced to other areas, including Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, Peru, Uruguay, Chile and Argentina. In many parts of the world, the meat ( venison ) from red deer is used as a food source.","The roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus ), also known as the roe, western roe deer, or European roe, is a species of deer. The male of the species is sometimes referred to as a roebuck. The roe is a small deer, reddish and grey-brown, and well-adapted to cold environments. The species is widespread in Europe, from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia, from Scotland to the Caucasus, and east as far as northern Iran.","No description available","No description available","No description available","No description available","Bryde's whale ( / \u02c8 b r \u028a d \u0259 z / BRUU -d\u0259z ), or the Bryde's whale complex, putatively comprises three species of rorqual and maybe four. The \" complex \" means the number and classification remains unclear because of a lack of definitive information and research. The common Bryde's whale ( Balaenoptera brydei, Olsen, 1913) is a larger form that occurs worldwide in warm temperate and tropical waters, and the Sittang or Eden's whale ( Balaenoptera edeni, Anderson, 1879) is a smaller form that may be restricted to the Indo-Pacific. Also, a smaller, coastal form of B. brydei is found off southern Africa, and perhaps another form in the Indo-Pacific differs in skull morphology, tentatively referred to as the Indo-Pacific Bryde's whale. The recently described Omura's whale ( B. omurai, Wada et al. 2003), was formerly thought to be a pygmy form of Bryde's, but is now recognized as a distinct species. Rice's whale ( B. ricei ), which makes its home solely in the Gulf of Mexico, was once considered a distinct population of Bryde's whale, but in 2021 it was described as a separate species.","No
