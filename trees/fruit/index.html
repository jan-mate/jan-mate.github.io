They also have a specialized non-lignified tissue (the phloem ) to conduct products of photosynthesis. The group includes most land plants ( c. 300,000 accepted known species) other than mosses.","The Zingiberales are flowering plants forming one of four orders in the commelinids clade of monocots, together with its sister order, Commelinales. The order includes 68 genera and 2,600 species. Zingiberales are a unique though morphologically diverse order that has been widely recognised as such over a long period of time. They are usually large herbaceous plants with rhizomatous root systems and lacking an aerial stem except when flowering. Flowers are usually large and showy, and the stamens are often modified ( staminodes ) to also form colourful petal-like structures that attract pollinators.","Musaceae is a family of flowering plants composed of three genera with about 91 known species, placed in the order Zingiberales. The family is native to the tropics of Africa and Asia. The plants have a large herbaceous growth habit with leaves with overlapping basal sheaths that form a pseudostem making some members appear to be woody trees. In most treatments, the family has three genera, Musa, Musella and Ensete.

Yews occur around the globe in temperate zones of the northern hemisphere, northernmost in Norway and southernmost in the South Celebes. Some populations exist in tropical highlands.","Cupressaceae or the cypress family is a family of conifers. The family includes 27\u201330 genera (17 monotypic ), which include the junipers and redwoods, with about 130\u2013140 species in total. They are monoecious, subdioecious or (rarely) dioecious trees and shrubs up to 116\u00a0m (381\u00a0ft) tall. The bark of mature trees is commonly orange- to red-brown and of stringy texture, often flaking or peeling in vertical strips, but smooth, scaly or hard and square-cracked in some species. The family reached its peak of diversity during the mesozoic era.","Junipers are coniferous trees and shrubs in the genus Juniperus ( / d\u0292 u\u02d0 \u02c8 n \u026a p \u0259r \u0259 s / joo- NIP -\u0259r-\u0259s ) of the cypress family Cupressaceae. Depending on the taxonomy, between 50 and 67 species of junipers are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere as far south as tropical Africa, including the Arctic, parts of Asia, and Central America. The highest-known juniper forest occurs at an altitude of 4,900 metres (16,100\u00a0ft) in southeastern Tibet and the northern Himalayas, creating one of the highest tree lines on

velutina, the hairy banana or pink banana, is a diploid species of wild banana. These plants are originally from Assam and the eastern Himalayas.","The plant species Musa ingens, also known as the giant highland banana or Oem, is the physically largest member of the family Musaceae and the only member of the section Ingentimusa. Growing in the tropical montane forests of New Guinea - Arfak Mountains Regency in Indonesia, its leaves can reach a length of 5 meters (16 feet) and a width of 1 m (39 in). This, the largest herbaceous plant on earth, was completely unknown to science prior to 1960.","Musa balbisiana, also known simply as plantain, is a wild-type species of banana. It is one of the ancestors of modern cultivated bananas, along with Musa acuminata.","Musa acuminata is a species of banana native to Southern Asia, its range comprising the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Many of the modern edible dessert bananas are from this species, although some are hybrids with Musa balbisiana. First cultivated by humans around 8000 BCE, it is one of the early examples of domesticated plants.","Vitis vinifera, the common grape vine, is a species of flowering plant, native to the Mediterranean region, Central Europe, and southwestern Asia, from Morocco and Portugal north to southern Germany and east to northern Iran. As of 2012, there were between 5,000 and 10,000 varieties of Vitis vinifera grapes though only a few are of commercial significance for wine and table grape production.","Vitis rotundifolia, or muscadine, is a grapevine species native to the southeastern and south-central United States. The growth range extends from Florida to New Jersey coast, and west to eastern Texas and Oklahoma. It has been extensively cultivated since the 16th century. The plants are well-adapted to their native warm and humid climate; they need fewer chilling hours than better known varieties, and thrive in summer heat.","Vitis labrusca, the fox grape, is a species of grapevines belonging to the Vitis genus in the flowering plant family Vitaceae. The vines are native to eastern North America and are the source of many grape cultivars, including Catawba, Concord, Delaware, Isabella, Niagara, and many hybrid grape varieties such as Agawam, Alexander and Onaka. Among the characteristics of this vine species in contrast to the European wine grape Vitis vinifera are its \"slip-skin\" that allows the skin of the grape berries to easily slip off when squeezed, instead of crushing the pulp, and the presence of tendrils on every node of the cane. Another contrast with European vinifera is the characteristic \"foxy\" musk of V. labrusca, best known to most people through the Concord grape. This musk is not related to the mammalian fox, but rather to the strong, earthy aromas characteristic of the grapes that were known by early European-American settlers in the New World. The term \"foxy\" became a sort of catchall for the wine tasting descriptors used for these American wines that were distinct from the familiar flavors of the European viniferous wines.","Solanum quitoense, known as naranjilla ( Spanish pronunciation: [na\u027ea\u014b\u02c8xi\u029da], \"little orange \") in Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Panama and as lulo ( [\u02c8lulo], from Quechua ) in Colombia, is a tropical perennial plant from northwestern South America.
