The order includes 68 genera and 2,600 species. Zingiberales are a unique though morphologically diverse order that has been widely recognised as such over a long period of time. They are usually large herbaceous plants with rhizomatous root systems and lacking an aerial stem except when flowering. Flowers are usually large and showy, and the stamens are often modified ( staminodes ) to also form colourful petal-like structures that attract pollinators.","Zingiberaceae ( / \u02cc z \u026a n d\u0292 \u026a b \u026a \u02c8 r e\u026a s i. i\u02d0 / ) or the ginger family is a family of flowering plants made up of about 50 genera with a total of about 1600 known species of aromatic perennial herbs with creeping horizontal or tuberous rhizomes distributed throughout tropical Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Many of the family's species are important ornamental, spice, or medicinal plants. Ornamental genera include the shell gingers ( Alpinia ), Siam or summer tulip ( Curcuma alismatifolia ), Globba, ginger lily ( Hedychium ), Kaempferia, torch-ginger Etlingera elatior, Renealmia, and ginger ( Zingiber ). Spices include ginger ( Zingiber ), galangal or Thai ginger ( Alpinia galanga and others), melegueta pepper ( Aframomum melegueta ), myoga ( Zingiber mioga ), korarima ( Aframomum corrorima ), turmeric ( Curcuma ), and cardamom ( Amomum, Elettaria ).","Zingiber is a genus of flowering plants in the family Zingiberaceae. It is native to China, the Indian Subcontinent, New Guinea, and Southeast Asia, especially Thailand. It contains the true gingers, plants grown the world over for their culinary value. The most well known species are Z. officinale and Z. mioga, two garden gingers.","The Vitaceae are a family of flowering plants, with 14 genera and around 910 known species, including common plants such as grapevines ( Vitis spp.) and Virginia creeper ( Parthenocissus quinquefolia ).

The genus consists of species predominantly from the Northern Hemisphere. It is economically important as the source of grapes, both for direct consumption of the fruit and for fermentation to produce wine. The study and cultivation of grapevines is called viticulture.","The Solanales are an order of flowering plants, included in the asterid group of the eudicots. Well-known members of Solanales include potatoes, eggplants, tomatoes, chilli peppers, tobacco, petunias, nightshades, morning glory, and sweet potato.

The name is based on the genus Polygonum, and was first used by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in 1789 in his book, Genera Plantarum. The name may refer to the many swollen nodes the stems of some species have, being derived from Greek [ poly meaning 'many' and gony meaning 'knee' or 'joint']. Alternatively, it may have a different origin, meaning 'many seeds'.","The docks and sorrels, genus Rumex, are a genus of about 200 species of annual, biennial, and perennial herbs in the buckwheat family, Polygonaceae.\nMembers of this genus are very common perennial herbs with a native almost worldwide distribution, and introduced species growing in the few places where the genus is not native.","Rheum ( / r u\u02d0 m /; from Greek: \u1fe5\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1 rheuma 'a flowing, rheum') is a thin mucus naturally discharged from the eyes, nose, or mouth, often during sleep (contrast with mucopurulent discharge ). Rheum dries and gathers as a crust in the corners of the eyes or the mouth, on the eyelids, or under the nose. It is formed by a combination of mucus (in the case of the eyes, consisting of mucin discharged from the cornea or the conjunctiva ), nasal mucus, blood cells, skin cells, or dust.","Polygonum is a genus of about 130 species of flowering plants in the buckwheat and knotweed family Polygonaceae. Common names include knotweed and knotgrass (though the common names may refer more broadly to plants from Polygonaceae ). In the Middle English glossary of herbs Alphita ( c. 1400\u20131425), it was known as ars-smerte. There have been various opinions about how broadly the genus should be defined. For example, buckwheat ( Fagopyrum esculentum ) has sometimes been included in the genus as Polygonum fagopyrum. Former genera such as Polygonella have been subsumed into Polygonum; other genera have been split off.","Persicaria is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants in the knotweed family, Polygonaceae. Plants of the genus are known commonly as knotweeds or smartweeds. It has a cosmopolitan distribution, with species occurring nearly worldwide. The genus was segregated from Polygonum.","Oxyria is a genus of plants in the family Polygonaceae with three accepted species as of March\u00a02019.

Though almost universally recognized by taxonomists, its circumscription has varied. It is also known as the Pokeweed family.","Phytolacca is a genus of perennial plants native to North America, South America and East Asia. Some members of the genus are known as pokeweeds or similar names such as pokebush, pokeberry, pokeroot or poke sallet. Other names for species of Phytolacca include inkberry and omb\u00fa. The generic name is derived from the Greek word \u03c6\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd ( phyton ), meaning \"plant,\" and the Latin word lacca, a red dye. Phytolaccatoxin and phytolaccigenin are present (in the leaves, stems, roots, blossoms, berries etc.) in many species which are poisonous to mammals if not prepared properly.

The family has a distinctive fruit type called an accessory fruit or anthocarp, and many genera have extremely large (&gt;100 \u03bcm ) pollen grains.","Pisonia is a genus of flowering plants in the four o'clock flower family, Nyctaginaceae. It was named for Dutch physician and naturalist Willem Piso (1611\u20131678). Certain species in this genus are known as catchbirdtrees, birdcatcher trees or birdlime trees because they catch birds. The sticky seeds are postulated to be an adaptation of some island species that ensures the dispersal of seeds between islands by attaching them to birds, and also allows the enriching of coralline sands. (Should a fledgling fall to the ground, become entangled in the Pisonia 's sticky seeds, and be unable to free itself, then it will starve, and so enrich the soil within the tree's rootzone. ) These island species include P. brunoniana of Australasia and Polynesia and P. umbellifera, which is widespread in the tropical Indo-Pacific region.","Mirabilis is a Latin adjective meaning \"amazing, wondrous, remarkable\", and is used to refer to:","Montiaceae are a family of flowering plants, comprising about 14 genera with about 230 known species, ranging from small herbaceous plants to shrubs.

It was previously included in the larger family Aizoaceae. The APG III system of 2009 made no change in the status of the family as compared to the APG II system of 2003 and the APG system of 1998, apart from a reassignment of several genera, such as the placement of Corrigiola and Telephium into Caryophyllaceae, Corbichonia in Lophiocarpaceae, Microtea into Microteaceae and Limeum in Limeaceae, because the family was found to be widely polyphyletic in Caryophyllales. In addition Macarthuria was found not to be related to Limeum as previously thought and thus it was placed in Macarthuriaceae, and similarly species formerly placed in Hypertelis, apart from type species Hypertelis spergulacea, a true Molluginaceae, were found to belong elsewhere and were described as Kewa in the family Kewaceae, named for the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew. Molluginaceae is still assigned to the order Caryophyllales in the clade core eudicots, although the generic circumscription is difficult because Mollugo is not monophyletic.","Glinus is a genus of tropical and subtropical plants in the family Molluginaceae.

They often float together in pairs or form floating mats with related plants, such as Lemna and Spirodela species.","Spirodela is a genus of aquatic plants, one of several genera containing plants commonly called duckweed. Spirodela species are members of the Araceae under the APG II system. They were formerly members of the Lemnaceae.","Pistia is a genus of aquatic plants in the arum family, Araceae. It is the sole genus in the tribe Pistieae which reflects its systematic isolation within the family. The single species it comprises, Pistia stratiotes, is often called water cabbage, water lettuce, Nile cabbage, or shellflower. Its native distribution is uncertain but is probably pantropical; it was first scientifically described from plants found on the Nile near Lake Victoria in Africa. It is now present, either naturally or through human introduction, in nearly all tropical and subtropical fresh waterways and is considered an invasive species as well as a mosquito breeding habitat. The specific epithet is derived from a Greek word, \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, meaning \"soldier\", which references the sword-shaped leaves of some plants in the Stratiotes genus.","Colocasia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae, native to southeastern Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Some species are widely cultivated and naturalized in other tropical and subtropical regions.","The water-plantains ( Alismataceae ) are a family of flowering plants, comprising 20 genera (17 extant and 3 fossil) and 119 species. The family has a cosmopolitan distribution, with the greatest number of species in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Most of the species are herbaceous aquatic plants growing in marshes and ponds.","Limnocharis is a genus of plants in the family Alismataceae, native to Mexico, Central America, the West Indies and South America, but naturalized in China, India, and Southeast Asia as well. Two species are recognized as of May 2014:","A pteridophyte is a vascular plant (with xylem and phloem ) that reproduces by means of spores. Because pteridophytes produce neither flowers nor seeds, they are sometimes referred to as \" cryptogams \", meaning that their means of reproduction is hidden. They are also the ancestors of the plants we see today.","The order Polypodiales encompasses the major lineages of polypod ferns, which comprise more than 80% of today's fern species. They are found in many parts of the world including tropical, semitropical and temperate areas.","Onocleaceae is a small family of terrestrial ferns in the order Polypodiales. It is placed in the suborder Aspleniineae in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). Alternatively, the family, along with Blechnaceae, may be placed in a very broadly defined family Aspleniaceae as the subfamily Blechnoideae. The family may contain from one to four genera, consisting of five species largely in north temperate climes. The four genera, Matteuccia, Onoclea, Onocleopsis and Pentarhizidium, may be included under the single genus Onoclea.","Onoclea is a genus of plants in the family Onocleaceae, native to moist habitats in eastern Asia and eastern North America. They are deciduous ferns with sterile fronds arising from creeping rhizomes in spring, dying down at first frost. Fertile fronds appear in late summer. Depending on the authority, the genus contains one to five species.","Matteuccia is a genus of ferns with one species: Matteuccia struthiopteris ( common names ostrich fern, fiddlehead fern, or shuttlecock fern ). The species epithet struthiopteris comes from Ancient Greek words \u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03b8\u03af\u03c9\u03bd ( strouth\u00ed\u014dn ) \"ostrich\" and \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03c2 ( pter\u00eds ) \"fern\".","Blechnaceae is a family of ferns in the order Polypodiales, with a cosmopolitan distribution. Its status as a family and the number of genera included have both varied considerably. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), the family has 24 genera, and excludes genera placed in the separate family Onocleaceae. The family is divided into three subfamilies, including Blechnoideae s.s. Alternatively, the entire family may be treated as the subfamily Blechnoideae s.l. of a very broadly defined family Aspleniaceae, and include genera others place in Onocleaceae.","Stenochlaena is a genus of ferns of the plant family Blechnaceae. Six species were formally accepted in an April 2013 scientific review of the genus, first written some years earlier and submitted in 2009. One additional species S.\u00a0hainanensis awaits confirmation of its difference from S.\u00a0palustris by means of differences in fertile material and/or its formal publication. One additional likely species grows naturally in Cameroon, Africa, recognised with the descriptive name Stenochlaena sp. 'Cameroon' but it awaits formal description.","The Athyriaceae (ladyferns and allies) are a family of terrestrial ferns in the order Polypodiales. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG\u00a0I), the family is placed in the suborder Aspleniineae, and includes two genera. Alternatively, it may be treated as the subfamily Athyrioideae of a very broadly defined family Aspleniaceae. The family has with a cosmopolitan distribution.","Diplazium is a genus of ferns that specifically includes the approximately 400 known species of twinsorus ferns. The Greek root is diplazein meaning double: the indusia in this genus lie on both sides of the vein. These ferns were earlier considered part of either the Athyriaceae, Dryopteridaceae, Aspleniaceae, or Polypodiaceae families or recognized as belonging to their own taxonomic family. The Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I) places the genus in the Athyriaceae. The taxonomy of the genus is difficult and poorly known, and by 2009 has never been the subject of a complete monographic study. Their distribution is pantropical, with a few species extending into temperate areas.","No description available","Pteridaceae is a family of ferns in the order Polypodiales, including some 1150 known species in ca 45 genera (depending on taxonomic opinions), divided over five subfamilies. The family includes four groups of genera that are sometimes recognized as separate families: the adiantoid, cheilanthoid, pteridoid, and hemionitidoid ferns. Relationships among these groups remain unclear, and although some recent genetic analyses of the Pteridales suggest that neither the family Pteridaceae nor the major groups within it are all monophyletic, as yet these analyses are insufficiently comprehensive and robust to provide good support for a revision of the order at the family level.","Pteris ( brake ) is a genus of about 300 species of ferns in the subfamily Pteridoideae of the family Pteridaceae. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions, southward to New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa, north to Japan and North America. 78 species (35 endemic) are found in China. Some species of Pteris have considerable economic and ecological value, such as Pteris multifida, Pteris ensiformis, Pteris vittata can be used for ornamental purposes; as a hyperaccumulator, Pteris multifida and Pteris vittata can be used to control soil pollution.","Osmundaceae (royal fern family) is a family of ferns containing four to six extant genera and 18\u201325 known species. It is the only living family of the order Osmundales in the class Polypodiopsida ( ferns ) or in some classifications the only order in the class Osmundopsida. This is an ancient (known from the Upper Permian ) and fairly isolated group that is often known as the \"flowering ferns\" because of the striking aspect of the ripe sporangia in Claytosmunda, Osmunda, Osmundastrum, and Plensium (subtribe Osmundinae ). In these genera the sporangia are borne naked on non-laminar pinnules, while Todea and Leptopteris (subtribe Todinae ) bear sporangia naked on laminar pinnules. Ferns in this family are larger than most other ferns.","Osmundaceae (royal fern family) is a family of ferns containing four to six extant genera and 18\u201325 known species.

The name honours Italian naturalist Luigi Ferdinando Marsili (1656\u20131730).","No description available","Rubiales may refer to:","The Valerianaceae Batsch, the valerian family, was a family of flowering plants that is now considered part of the Caprifoliaceae. Plants are generally herbaceous, and their foliage often has a strong, disagreeable odor. They are found native in most regions of the world except for Australia. Some species are cultivated as ornamentals or used in herbal medicine for inducing relaxation and sleep.","Valerianella is a genus of flowering plant in family Caprifoliaceae. It includes 23 species native to the Mediterranean Basin of southern Europe and North Africa, western and central Asia, Madeira and the Azores, and Ethiopia and Kenya. Many species formerly placed in Valerianella, including those native to the Americas, have been moved to Valeriana. Plants of Valerianella and Valeriana are sometimes known by the common name corn salad or cornsalad.","Patrinia is a genus of herbaceous plants in the honeysuckle family ( Caprifoliaceae ). It includes 14 species native to grassy mountain habitats from eastern European Russia to China, Siberia, Korea, and Japan. These are unassuming clump-forming perennial plants having thin, erect stems with few leaves and bearing a terminal inflorescence with yellow or white flowers.","The Solanales are an order of flowering plants, included in the asterid group of the eudicots. Well-known members of Solanales include potatoes, eggplants, tomatoes, chilli peppers, tobacco, petunias, nightshades, morning glory, and sweet potato. Some older sources used the name Polemoniales for this order.","Hydrophylloideae is a subfamily of the plant family Boraginaceae. Its taxonomic position is somewhat uncertain. Traditionally, and under the Cronquist system, the taxon was given family rank under the name Hydrophyllaceae, and treated as part of the order Solanales. More recent systems have recognised a close relationship to the borage family, Boraginaceae, initially by placing Hydrophyllaceae and Boraginaceae together in an order Boraginales, and in the 2016 APG IV system by including Hydrophyllaceae in Boraginaceae. However, the placement and circumscription of Boraginaceae is still uncertain. Some sources now split off Hydrophyllaceae again (together with Namaceae).","Hydrophyllum is a genus of herbaceous perennial plants in the borage family. It consists of ten species, all of which are native to North America.","Gnetophyta ( / n \u025b \u02c8 t \u0252 f \u026a t \u0259, \u02c8 n \u025b t o\u028a f a\u026a t \u0259 / ) is a division of plants (alternatively considered the subclass Gnetidae or order Gnetales ), grouped within the gymnosperms (which also includes conifers, cycads, and ginkgos ), that consists of some 70 species across the three relict genera: Gnetum ( family Gnetaceae), Welwitschia (family Welwitschiaceae ), and Ephedra (family Ephedraceae ). The earliest unambiguous records of the group date to the Jurassic, and they achieved their highest diversity during the Early Cretaceous. The primary difference between gnetophytes and other gymnosperms is the presence of vessel elements, a system of small tubes ( xylem ) that transport water within the plant, similar to those found in flowering plants. Because of this, gnetophytes were once thought to be the closest gymnosperm relatives to flowering plants, but more recent molecular studies have brought this hypothesis into question, with many recent phylogenies finding them to be nested within the conifers.","Gnetum is a genus of gymnosperms, the sole genus in the family Gnetaceae within the Gnetophyta. They are tropical evergreen trees, shrubs and lianas. Unlike other gymnosperms, they possess vessel elements in the xylem. Some species have been proposed to have been the first plants to be insect- pollinated as their fossils occur in association with extinct pollinating scorpionflies. Molecular phylogenies based on nuclear and plastid sequences from most of the species indicate hybridization among some of the Southeast Asian species. Fossil-calibrated molecular-clocks suggest that the Gnetum lineages now found in Africa, South America and Southeast Asia are the result of ancient long-distance dispersal across seawater.","Gnetum is a genus of gymnosperms, the sole genus in the family Gnetaceae within the Gnetophyta.

The distinguishing characteristic is the reproductive structure known as a cone produced by all Pinales. All of the extant conifers, such as Araucaria, cedar, celery-pine, cypress, fir, juniper, kauri, larch, pine, redwood, spruce, and yew, are included here. Some fossil conifers, however, belong to other distinct orders within the division Pinophyta.","The Pinaceae ( / p \u026a \u02c8 n e\u026a s i\u02d0 \u02cc i\u02d0, - s i \u02cc a\u026a / ), or pine family, are conifer trees or shrubs, including many of the well-known conifers of commercial importance such as cedars, firs, hemlocks, pi\u00f1ons, larches, pines and spruces. The family is included in the order Pinales, formerly known as Coniferales. Pinaceae have distinctive cones with woody scales bearing typically two ovules, and are supported as monophyletic by both morphological trait and genetic analysis. They are the largest extant conifer family in species diversity, with between 220 and 250 species (depending on taxonomic opinion) in 11 genera, and the second-largest (after Cupressaceae ) in geographical range, found in most of the Northern Hemisphere, with the majority of the species in temperate climates, but ranging from subarctic to tropical. The family often forms the dominant component of boreal, coastal, and montane forests. One species, Pinus merkusii, grows just south of the equator in Southeast Asia. Major centres of diversity are found in the mountains of southwest China, Mexico, central Japan, and California.","A pine is any conifer tree or shrub in the genus Pinus ( / \u02c8 p a\u026a n \u0259 s / ) of the family Pinaceae.

zerumbet is a species of plant in the ginger family with leafy stems growing to about 1.2\u00a0m (3.9\u00a0ft) tall. It originates from Asia, but can be found in many tropical countries. Common names include: awapuhi (from Hawaiian: \u02bbawapuhi spelled with an \u02bbokina, doublet of \u02bbawa ), bitter ginger, shampoo ginger, lempoyang (from Malay ) and pinecone ginger.","Vitis vinifera, the common grape vine, is a species of flowering plant, native to the Mediterranean region, Central Europe, and southwestern Asia, from Morocco and Portugal north to southern Germany and east to northern Iran. As of 2012, there were between 5,000 and 10,000 varieties of Vitis vinifera grapes though only a few are of commercial significance for wine and table grape production.","Vitis shuttleworthii is a North American liana (woody vine) in the grape family commonly known as the calloose grape or bear grape (alternatively referred as calusa grape ). The name refers to the group of Native American people that resided in southwest Florida, the Calusa. It is native to south and central Florida, with isolated populations in southern Alabama.","Vitis labrusca, the fox grape, is a species of grapevines belonging to the Vitis genus in the flowering plant family Vitaceae. The vines are native to eastern North America and are the source of many grape cultivars, including Catawba, Concord, Delaware, Isabella, Niagara, and many hybrid grape varieties such as Agawam, Alexander and Onaka. Among the characteristics of this vine species in contrast to the European wine grape Vitis vinifera are its \"slip-skin\" that allows the skin of the grape berries to easily slip off when squeezed, instead of crushing the pulp, and the presence of tendrils on every node of the cane. Another contrast with European vinifera is the characteristic \"foxy\" musk of V. labrusca, best known to most people through the Concord grape. This musk is not related to the mammalian fox, but rather to the strong, earthy aromas characteristic of the grapes that were known by early European-American settlers in the New World. The term \"foxy\" became a sort of catchall for the wine tasting descriptors used for these American wines that were distinct from the familiar flavors of the European viniferous wines.","Vitis coignetiae, called crimson glory vine, is a plant belonging to the genus Vitis that is native to the temperate climes of Asia, where it can be found in the Russian Far East, ( Sakhalin ); Korea; and Japan ( Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku ). It was described botanically in 1883. It is called meoru ( \uba38\ub8e8 ) in Korean and yama-budo ( \u30e4\u30de\u30d6\u30c9\u30a6 ) in Japanese.","Vitis californica, with common names California wild grape, Northern California grape, and Pacific grape, is a wild grape species widespread across much of California as well as southwestern Oregon.","Vitis amurensis, the Amur grape, is a species of grape native to the Asian continent. Its name comes from the Amur Valley in Russia and China.","Sphenoclea zeylanica, called chickenspike, gooseweed, and wedgewort, is a widespread species of flowering plant in the genus Sphenoclea, native to Africa, Madagascar, tropical and subtropical Asia, and Australia. It is widely introduced in the New World tropics and subtopics from the southern United States to northern Argentina.

As its specific epithet suggests, it is dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate plants. The flowers are pollinated by the butterfly Doxocopa laurentia. It has an umbrella-like canopy that spreads to a diameter of 12 to 15 meters (40 to 50 feet) and can attain a height of 12 to 18 meters (40 to 60 feet). This upper growth springs up from a tuberous caudex which, according to Everett \"may occupy a circle sixty feet [18 meters] in diameter\". One tree of such a size\u2014mentioned by Anglo-Argentine writer William Henry Hudson in his autobiography Far Away and Long Ago \u2014was 50 feet (15\u00a0m) girth above the caudex. Another large specimen, observed in 1867 by David Christison, at Belgrano, Buenos Aires, Argentina, measured \"32 feet (9.8\u00a0m) in girth...clear of the projecting buttresses\". Because it is derived from herbaceous ancestors, its trunk consists of anomalous secondary thickening rather than true wood. As a result, the omb\u00fa grows fast but its wood is soft and spongy enough to be cut with a knife. These properties have led it to be used in the art of bonsai, as it is easily manipulated to create the desired effect. Since the sap is poisonous, the omb\u00fa is not grazed by cattle and is immune to locusts and other pests. For similar reasons, the leaves are sometimes used as a laxative or purgative.
